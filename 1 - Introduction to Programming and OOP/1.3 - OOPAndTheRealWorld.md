##OOP and the real world

Object oriented programming is all about the real world. It is about representing real world things in programming. Objects allow for programmers to group entities and functions related to real world objects together. Let's take an example, if we are to represent babies in programming, we simply define a class that groups the variables and methods that relate to babies. In the following manner.

```
class Baby {
  String name;
  boolean isMale;
  double weight;
  String dateOfBirth;
  int age;

  void addAgeOnBirthday() {
    age = age + 1;
  }  

}
```

This could define a class that describes babies, such that every object i.e. every baby has their own copy of variables and methods related to babies. This achieves simplicity. Imagine, that we are trying to define 4 babies. If we didn't have classes we would have to define it in the following manner.

```
public static void main(String args[]) {
  String name1, name2, name3, name4;
  boolean isMale1, isMale2, isMale3, isMale4;
  double weight1, weight2, weight3, weight4;
  String dateOfBirth1, dateOfBirth2. dateOfBirth3, dateOfBirth4;
}
```

And, additionally we will have to define 4 separate functions for each of them. This is the problem that OOP solves, and it does so by providing classes, with which we can form blueprints for objects of a certain kind. These objects are modeled after real world entities like people, cars, animals, etc or could even be abstract entities related to the projects that programmers create.

There is no associated java file to explain the concepts of this section, as relevant examples are in this file.
